## Week 10 - Security and privacy | practice assignment

### Assignment 1 

- Read user data from an API. Using the https://randomuser.me/ API you would need to read in 100 users.

- Mask or anonymize PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

- Save the data as encrypted parquet files on Minio. The data should have a flat structure (no arrays or structs)


### The following analytical questions should still be answerable with the data:

- What is the average duration since a user registered?
  
- What is the age and gender distribution of users?
  
- Which location (country and city) do most users come from?
